Lesser
======

`lesser` is a minimal reimplementation of the standard `less` pager.  It aims to
be very fast, particularly for searching the file.

`lesser` is very much a work-in-progress.

The currently supported keybindings are as follows:

* `j`: Scroll down
* `k`: Scroll up
* `g`: Scroll to top
* `G`: Scroll to bottom
* `q`: Quit
